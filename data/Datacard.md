## 3. Example of Data Points
#### Primary Data Modality
- Audio Data

#### Sampling of Data Points
- Demo Link: https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets
- Typical Data Point Link: https://github.com/roshan-rs-git/cs5661-dsproject-Multi-Attribute-Speech-Analysis-System/blob/main/notebooks/gender.ipynb

The primary data modality is audio data, supported by structured tabular metadata and transcribed text. Each data point consists of:
- An .mp3 file containing the recorded voice of a speaker
- A transcription (text) of the audio
- Demographic labels (age, gender, accent)
- Metadata (up_votes, down_votes, duration)

This multimodal structure enables diverse modeling approaches, including classification (gender, accent), regression (age group estimation), and sequence prediction (transcription).

To ensure data quality and balanced representation across tasks, the following sampling techniques were applied:
- **Filtering Rules**:
  - For general preprocessing: retained only rows where up_votes â‰¥ down_votes
  - For the invalid.tsv file: applied a stricter threshold of up_votes > down_votes
- **Task-Specific Sampling**:
  - Speech-to-Text: Focused on high-agreement clips using both text and audio features
  - Gender Prediction: Retained entries with non-missing gender values
  - Age/Accent Prediction: Focused on rows where the target label was present

#### Data Fields
Field Name | Field Value | Description
--- | --- | ---
path | cv-valid-train/sample-000001.mp3 | Path to audio clip
text | "everything in the universe evolved he said" | Transcription of the spoken sentence
age | 30s | Reported age group of the speaker
gender | male | Reported gender
accent | us | Reported accent/dialect
up_votes | 5 | Number of community upvotes
down_votes | 0 | Number of community downvotes
duration | 3.2 | Length of the audio clip in seconds
mfcc_1_mean | -456.23 | Mean of MFCC coefficient 1
spectral_centroid | 2340.45 | Spectral brightness of the audio
rms_energy | 0.0052 | RMS energy of the signal

**Caption:** Example field values and their corresponding descriptions used in model training.
**Additional Notes:** MFCC features (13 mean and std values) and spectral features were derived from PyTorchAudio transformations.

#### Typical Data Point
```
{
  "path": "cv-valid-train/sample-000001.mp3",
  "text": "everything in the universe evolved he said",
  "age": "30s",
  "gender": "male",
  "accent": "us",
  "up_votes": 5,
  "down_votes": 0,
  "duration": 3.2,
  "mfcc_1_mean": -456.23,
  "mfcc_1_std": 18.56,
  "spectral_centroid_mean": 2340.45,
  "rms_energy_mean": 0.0052
}
```

**Additional Notes:** This example is considered typical as it includes complete, consistent metadata and strong community validation. It is usable for all modeling tasks.

#### Atypical Data Point
```
{
  "path": "cv-valid-train/sample-5678.mp3",
  "text": "",
  "age": "",
  "gender": "",
  "accent": "",
  "up_votes": 0,
  "down_votes": 3,
  "duration": 1.1
}
```

**Additional Notes:** This data point is atypical due to missing text and demographic labels, and because the community flagged the clip as problematic. Such entries were excluded from our preprocessing pipeline.

## 14. Terms of Art
### Concepts and Definitions referenced in this Data Card

#### Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
Definition: A representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency. MFCCs are commonly used as features in speech and speaker recognition systems.

Source: Davis, S., & Mermelstein, P. (1980). Comparison of parametric representations for monosyllabic word recognition in continuously spoken sentences. IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 28(4), 357-366. https://doi.org/10.1109/TASSP.1980.1163420

Interpretation: In our project, MFCCs are the primary features extracted from speech audio files to capture the unique characteristics of speech that help in predicting age, gender, accent, and transcribed text. We extract both mean and standard deviation values for 13 MFCC coefficients.

#### Spectral Centroid
Definition: A measure used in digital signal processing to characterize a spectrum. It indicates where the "center of mass" of the spectrum is located and is calculated as the weighted mean of the frequencies present in the signal, with their magnitudes as weights.

Source: Peeters, G. (2004). A large set of audio features for sound description (similarity and classification) in the CUIDADO project. CUIDADO IST Project Report, 54(0), 1-25.

Interpretation: In our speech analysis system, spectral centroid features help capture the brightness or clarity of a speaker's voice, which can vary based on age, gender, and accent. We use both mean and standard deviation of the spectral centroid.

#### Root Mean Square (RMS)
Definition: A statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity, calculated as the square root of the mean of the squares of the values. In audio processing, RMS is used to measure the average power of an audio signal.

Source: Lerch, A. (2012). An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis: Applications in Signal Processing and Music Informatics. Wiley-IEEE Press. https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118393550

Interpretation: In our system, RMS features help capture the overall energy and volume characteristics of speech, which can vary based on speaker demographics. We extract both mean and standard deviation of RMS values.

#### Mel Energy
Definition: The energy measurement of an audio signal after it has been transformed to the mel scale, which is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another.

Source: Stevens, S. S., Volkmann, J., & Newman, E. B. (1937). A scale for the measurement of the psychological magnitude pitch. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 8(3), 185-190. https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1915893

Interpretation: Mel energy features in our system help capture the perceptual energy distribution across the frequency spectrum of speech, which varies significantly between different demographic groups and can help in accent and gender identification.

#### Common Voice Dataset
Definition: An open-source dataset of voiced recordings created by Mozilla, designed to help train and test machine learning algorithms for voice recognition.

Source: Ardila, R., et al. (2020). Common Voice: A Massively-Multilingual Speech Corpus. Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 4218-4222. https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.520/

Interpretation: This is the primary dataset used in our Multi-Attribute-Speech-Analysis-System, providing audio samples along with metadata including speaker age, gender, accent, and transcribed text, allowing for supervised learning of multiple attributes from speech.

#### Multi-task Learning
Definition: A machine learning approach where a single model is trained to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously, often leading to improved generalization performance compared to training separate models for each task.

Source: Caruana, R. (1997). Multitask Learning. Machine Learning, 28(1), 41-75. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1007379606734

Interpretation: While our current approach uses separate neural networks for each attribute prediction task, multi-task learning represents a potential future direction where a shared base network with specialized heads could improve overall performance through learned shared representations.

#### Feature Extraction
Definition: The process of transforming raw data into a set of features that can be effectively processed by machine learning algorithms while still representing the original data with sufficient accuracy.

Source: Zheng, A., & Casari, A. (2018). Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists. O'Reilly Media.

Interpretation: In our system, feature extraction involves transforming raw audio waveforms into meaningful representations (MFCCs, spectral features, etc.) that capture relevant characteristics for predicting age, gender, accent, and text.

#### Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Definition: A class of machine learning algorithms that use multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) to model complex patterns in data and make predictions or classifications.

Interpretation: We use separate DNNs to predict each attribute (age, gender, accent, and text) from the extracted audio features, with architectures tailored to the specific classification or regression task.

#### Word Error Rate (WER)
Definition: A common metric for evaluating automatic speech recognition systems, calculated as the sum of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors divided by the total number of words in the reference.

Interpretation: WER serves as an evaluation metric for the text prediction component of our system, measuring how accurately the model can transcribe spoken content from audio features.

#### Z-score Normalization
Definition: A data preprocessing technique that transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, calculated by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

Interpretation: We apply z-score normalization to our extracted audio features to ensure all features contribute equally to model training regardless of their original scales, improving convergence and performance of our neural networks.

#### F1-Score
Definition: A measure of a model's accuracy that considers both precision and recall, calculated as their harmonic mean. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance.

Source: Powers, D. M. W. (2011). Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Measure to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation. Journal of Machine Learning Technologies, 2(1), 37-63.

Interpretation: F1-score serves as an evaluation metric for our classification tasks (gender and accent prediction), providing a balanced measure of the model's ability to correctly identify classes while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## 15. Reflections on Data

### Data Imbalance Considerations
The Common Voice dataset exhibits imbalances in demographic representation, with certain age groups, genders, and accents having significantly more samples than others. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform better on well-represented groups. We address this through stratified sampling during training/validation splits and by implementing class weights in our loss functions to give more importance to underrepresented classes during training.

### Audio Quality Variation
The dataset contains recordings from diverse sources with varying audio quality, microphone types, and background noise levels. These variations can affect feature extraction and model performance. Our preprocessing pipeline includes normalization of audio features to mitigate these effects, but future work could incorporate more robust features or data augmentation techniques to further address quality inconsistencies.

### Ethical Considerations in Demographic Prediction
Developing systems that predict personal attributes such as age and gender from voice raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy, consent, and potential misuse. While our system aims to demonstrate technical capabilities in multi-attribute prediction, real-world applications should implement appropriate safeguards, obtain proper consent, and consider potential discriminatory impacts. The system should be developed and deployed responsibly with transparency about its capabilities and limitations.

### Feature Selection Methodology
Our current approach of testing different numbers of MFCC coefficients through trial and error is computationally expensive and may not yield optimal results. Future iterations could implement more systematic feature selection techniques such as mutual information analysis, recursive feature elimination, or principal component analysis to identify the most relevant features for each prediction task, potentially improving model performance while reducing computational requirements.
